# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends within film, video and television industry
## Overview of Project
Crowdfunding can be an alternative and somewhat more popular way of getting projects the necessary funding it needs to its target audience. Kickstarter is one such crowdfunding platform where creators can propose a project in order to have regular consumers back (fund) the project with their own money. Not all projects are successful; some can miss the funding goal either by a wide or small margin, the date for when the Kickstarter ends had passed, or it simply got canceled. In this particular dataset, Louise has gathered Kickstarter data from the last few decades or so to truly see just how much of an influence crowdfunding can be so she can make calculated decisions on her campaign with confidence. The purpose of this particualr dataset is to analyze the outcomes for certain projects based on filters including year, category/ subcategory, and outcome in order to make Lousie's campaign goals and pledging into successful outcomes
## Analysis and Challenges
There are quite a few, effective ways to analyze a dataset especially one with as many filters as this Kickstarter data sets. Through the use of tools such as creating PivotCharts, line and box-and-whisker charts, we can develop logistical conclusions in determining how certain filters positively or negatively affect each other.

### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the chart labeled "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch data, we filter the dataset by the number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes. According to the chart, we can see the highest number of successful outcomes peaked in the month of May but saw a a rapid decline back to March levels of success. An observation can be made inferring that May was probably the most successful in terms of theaters meeting their crowdfunding goals due to the warm weather. This inference can also be applied to the later months of summer (June through September) as we can see, despite the decline, these months still had high successful outcomes therefore people are interested in activities in warmer months. 

The number of failed campaigns stayed relatively close to each other in terms of number per month. This could be that not all theater campaigns cater to everyones specifc tastes. It is difficult to gauge every individual's personal tastes or it could be other factors that led to failed outcomes such as not meeting its goal within its crowdfunding period/ The number of canceled outcomes stayed below 10% throughout the calendar year, the highest being in the month of January. Some possible reasons for cancelations could be the project never fully developed beyond its crowdfunding initiative but there is no real way to determine the cause.
